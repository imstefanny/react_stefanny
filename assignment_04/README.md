This branch is created by owner to submit her assignment for `ReactJS for Front End Web Developer` course held by `MSIB x Hacktiv8`.

This assignment is about creating my profile page implementing local storage to save the data.

Here's the result of `Assignment 04: My Profile`:
|State|View|Storage|
|---|---|---|
|Initial|![initial-view](/assignment_04/result/initial-view.png)|![initial-storage](/assignment_04/result/initial-storage.png)|
|After Editing|![form-submit](/assignment_04/result/form-submit.png)|
|Reload Page|![result-view](/assignment_04/result/result-view.png)|![result-storage](/assignment_04/result/result-storage.png)|
